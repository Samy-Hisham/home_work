// What will be the output of this code snippet? Explain your answer: ```dart void main() { int x = 5; int y = x + 2 * 3; print(y); } ```

/*

This is due to the priorities of mathematical operations in mathematics.

Conventional order
The order of operations, that is, the order in which the operations in an expression are usually performed, results from a convention adopted throughout mathematics, science, technology and many computer programming languages. It is summarized as:[2][5]

Parentheses
Exponentiation
Multiplication and division
Addition and subtraction

The expression x + 2 * 3 is evaluated to calculate the value of y.
According to the rules of operator precedence in Dart (and many programming languages), multiplication (*) has a higher precedence than addition (+). Therefore, the expression is evaluated as follows:
First, 2 * 3 is calculated, resulting in 6.
Then, x + 6 is calculated. Since x is 5, this results in 5 + 6, which equals 11.
